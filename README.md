# Meteocons
Free to use animated SVG weather icons. Handcrafted by [Bas Milius](https://bas.dev).

### âš’ Process
- An icon is desined in Adobe Illustrator.
- Icons are exported to plain SVG files.
- Animations are added by editing svg files.
- A node.js script minifies the SVG's.

### ðŸŽ¨ Design files
This repository not only contains the production-ready files, but also the original design
files. You may use these files to adjust icons or even create new ones. The design files
are Adobe Illustrator .ai-files.

### ðŸŒ¥ Missing an icon?
Please let me know by creating an issue. Keep in mind that I only accept icons that are
somewhat weather related.
